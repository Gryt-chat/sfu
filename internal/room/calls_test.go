/*
Ending a call somebody is alone in, and not ending anything else (GRYT-711).

Two things have to be true at once and they pull against each other. A call
with one person left in it is over and should be hung up. A voice channel with
one person in it is somebody waiting for a friend, and hanging that up is a bug
people would feel immediately. Both are the same kind of SFU room, so the only
thing separating them is the id.
