## Docker

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/gryt-chat/sfu:latest
docker run -p 5005:5005 -p 3478:3478/udp --env-file .env ghcr.io/gryt-chat/sfu:latest
```

## Quick start (development)

```bash
cp env.example .env
go run ./cmd/sfu
```

Starts on **http://localhost:5005**.

## Codecs

Registered in preference order: H.264, VP9, VP8, AV1. H.264 goes first because
it has the widest hardware-accelerated support across browsers and platforms,
which matters more in practice than the compression the others win on.

Video is forwarded per temporal layer rather than whole. `internal/svc` reads the
dependency descriptor and drops packets above a receiver's subscribed layer, so a
client on a poor connection gets a lower frame rate instead of a stalled track.

## Configuration

See `env.example` for all options. Key variables:

Every variable the SFU reads, and nothing it doesn't:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SFU_PORT` | `5005` | HTTP/WebSocket port. `PORT` is read as a fallback |
| `STUN_SERVERS` | `stun:stun.l.google.com:19302` | Comma-separated STUN servers |
| `DISABLE_STUN` | `false` | Stop discovering srflx candidates. Only safe with a direct, port-preserving path to the internet |
| `ICE_UDP_MUX_PORT` | `3478` | The one UDP port all media flows over |
| `ICE_ADVERTISE_IP` | — | Comma-separated IPs to advertise as host candidates, replacing the ones found on the interfaces |
| `MAX_PEERS` | `200` | How many peers may be connected at once |
| `SFU_PING_INTERVAL` | `30` | Seconds between WebSocket pings. `0` switches pinging and the read deadline off |
| `SFU_PONG_TIMEOUT` | `90` | Seconds a peer may say nothing before the SFU hangs up. Raised to two ping intervals if set lower |
| `DEBUG` | `true` | Room, connection and signaling logging. Defaults on when unset |
| `VERBOSE_LOG` | `false` | RTP forwarding detail |
